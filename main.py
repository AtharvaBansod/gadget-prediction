# ### âœ… How to Run Your New Project

# 1.  **Install Requirements:**
#     Open your terminal in the `gadget_search_engine` directory.
#     ```bash
#     pip install -r requirements.txt
#     ```

# 2.  **Run the Main Script:**
#     ```bash
#     python main.py
#     ```

#     *   The **first time** you run this, it will see that `models/gadgets.faiss` doesn't exist. It will automatically call the `builder.py` script. You will see a progress bar as it downloads the sentence model and encodes your gadget functions. It will then save the index.
#     *   **Every subsequent time**, it will find the index and load it instantly, skipping the build step.

# 3.  **Test It!**
#     The interactive prompt will start. Try these queries:

#     *   `> I want to fly`
#     *   `> A machine to go to the past or future`
#     *   `> something that helps me understand other languages`
#     *   `> a cannon that shoots air`

#     You will see that the results are now highly relevant, accurate, and returned instantly. This is the correct and modern way to solve your problem.
